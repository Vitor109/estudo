sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 5,756s
classified50,000.txt -> 0.644s

 Sort1 was the fastest at sorting the sorted files.

sort2 uses:  Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 0.459s

In use on an inverted txt file of 50,000 numbers, it was exponentially faster compared to other sorting programs.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 4,021s
classified50,000.txt -> 3,574s

This was the lowest speed sorting program on a text file with reversed numbers and on a sorted text file. Therefore, we can conclude that this is a selection order.
